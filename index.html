              <h4>Open an account in minutes</h4>
              <p>
    Opening an account with us takes just minutes, and because we don’t believe in branches, you can set one up directly from your phone.</p>
              <h4>Built-in budgeting </h4>
              <p>
    We’ll show you exactly where your money is going each month, and even let you set up monthly budgets for things like restaurants and groceries. </p>
    <h4> Stash away your spare change </h4>
    <p>
    Round up every card payment to the nearest whole number, and we'll stash your spare change away for you to put towards your goals </p><h4>
Instant spending notifications</h4>
<p>
    We’ll send you a notification the second you make a payment with your card, even before the receipt has finished printing.</p>

              <h4>Spend abroad</h4>
              <p>
    We don’t believe in financial borders, so it’s only fair that we let you spend abroad in over 150 currencies with the interbank exchange rate, with a small 0.5% fee for anything above £5,000 each month. A flat mark-up on weekends and on certain currencies may apply.</p>
              <h4>Withdraw money abroad </h4>
              <p>
    Although ATM withdrawals cost us money, we give you £200 a month in international ATM withdrawals for free. Anything over £200 attracts a small 2% fee to help us cover our costs. </p>
